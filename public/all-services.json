Make sure your child spits out the toothpaste after brushing – if young children swallow too much fluoride toothpaste, their adult teeth may have white spots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around age 7 or 8, kids can start to brush their own teeth.

Both men and women can have AAA, but it's more common in men.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Risk factors for AAA include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Family history – for example, if a parent or sibling had AAA</li>\r\n\t<li>Smoking</li>\r\n\t<li>Older age</li>\r\n\t<li>High blood pressure</li>\r\n\t<li>High cholesterol</li>\r\n\t<li>Heart disease or vascular disease (problems with blood vessels)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is AAA?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The aorta is your body’s main artery. An artery is a blood vessel (or tube) that carries blood from your heart. The aorta carries blood from your heart to your abdomen, pelvis, and legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the wall of your aorta is weak, it can swell up like a balloon. This balloon-like swelling is called an aneurysm (“AN-yoor-izm”). AAA is an aneurysm that happens in the part of the aorta running through the abdomen.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why do I need to talk to the doctor?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Aneurysms usually grow slowly without any symptoms. When aneurysms grow large enough to rupture (burst), they can cause dangerous bleeding inside the body that can lead to death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If AAA is found early, it can be treated before it bursts. That’s why it’s so important to talk to your doctor about your risk.</p>\r\n"

Ultrasounds are usually painless.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are the symptoms of AAA?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>AAA doesn't usually cause symptoms until it’s a medical emergency. Blood vessels like the aorta can swell up slowly over time, so it’s important to talk with your doctor about AAA to see if you need to get tested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A ruptured aneurysm can cause dangerous bleeding that can lead to death.

Some people may need to get their cholesterol checked more or less often depending on their risk of heart disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, high cholesterol can run in families. If someone in your family has high cholesterol or takes medicine to control&nbsp;cholesterol, you might need to get tested more often.&nbsp;Talk to your doctor about what’s best for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is cholesterol?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Cholesterol is a waxy material&nbsp;that’s found naturally in your blood. Your body makes&nbsp;cholesterol and uses it to do important things, like making&nbsp;hormones and digesting fatty foods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have too much cholesterol in your body, it can build up inside your blood vessels and make it hard for blood to flow through them.

For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Meningococcal disease&nbsp;can cause the loss of an arm or leg – and can even be deadly.</li>\r\n\t<li>Tetanus can cause muscle spasms, breathing problems, paralysis (loss of muscle function), and death.</li>\r\n\t<li>HPV can cause some types of cancers later in life.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Some serious diseases can spread easily from person to person, like the flu and whooping cough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As kids grow older, some of their childhood vaccines begin to wear off. That’s why it’s important to get the Tdap booster shot. Also, pre-teens and teens are at increased&nbsp;risk for some diseases as they get older, like meningococcal disease and HPV infections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>It’s important for every child to get shots.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to shots, many serious childhood diseases that used to be common are now rare.

Try changing smoke alarm batteries when you change your clock back from daylight saving time in the fall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow these other tips for using&nbsp;smoke&nbsp;alarms:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Test your smoke alarms once a month by pushing the test button.</li>\r\n\t<li>Put smoke alarms on every floor of your home and near places where people sleep.</li>\r\n\t<li>Don’t forget to put a smoke alarm in the basement.</li>\r\n\t<li>Replace your smoke alarm if it doesn’t work when tested or if it’s more than 10 years old.</li>\r\n\t<li>Dust or vacuum smoke alarms when you change the batteries.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://health.gov/myhealthfinder/api/outlink/topicsearch.json/http/www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/fief/handouts/fief_smoke_alarm_flyer.pdf?_label_=Get+more+fire+safety+tips+%5BPDF+-+3+MB%5D\" id=\"anch_71\">Get more fire safety tips [PDF - 3 MB]</a>.</p>\r\n"

Your support can help them make healthy choices and avoid risks as they grow up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It may be hard to know where to start, especially if your parents didn’t talk to you about sex when you were growing up. The following tips and strategies can help.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What do I say?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Kids have different questions and concerns about sex at different ages. As your children get&nbsp;older, the things you talk about will change. Remember to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Talk early and often — you don’t have to fit everything into 1&nbsp;conversation!</li>\r\n\t<li>Be ready to answer questions — children’s questions can tell you a lot about what they already know</li>\r\n\t<li>Listen carefully to your kids' opinions, even if you don’t agree</li>\r\n\t<li>Try using things that come up on TV, music, or social media to start a conversation</li>\r\n\t<li>Be honest about how you're feeling — for example, if you're embarrassed or uncomfortable, it’s okay to say so</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Will talking to my kids really make a difference?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Parents are the most important influence on a teen's decisions about sex and relationships —&nbsp;even more important than friends, siblings, or the media. Most teens say that it would be easier to make decisions about sex if they could talk openly and honestly with their parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teens who talk with their parents about sex are more likely to put off having sex until they're older. They're also more likely to make healthy choices, like using condoms to prevent pregnancy and STDs (sexually transmitted diseases), if they do choose to have sex.</p>\r\n"

Depending on your family health history, you may want to ask the doctor for extra tests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most newborn screening tests use a few drops of blood taken from the heel of your baby’s foot. The same sample of blood can be used to test for many different diseases, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong><em>Hypothyroidism</em></strong>&nbsp;– The thyroid is a gland in the neck that makes the thyroid hormone. Hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone) can cause&nbsp;problems with growth and&nbsp;development, but it can be treated if it’s found early.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong><em>PKU (phenylketonuria)</em></strong>&nbsp;– People with PKU can’t process certain foods. To make up for the foods they can’t eat, they have to drink a special formula. PKU can also cause intellectual disability (mental skills that are below average) if it’s not treated early.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong><em>Sickle cell disease&nbsp;</em></strong>– This is a blood disorder that can cause serious pain, infections, or stroke.

The information below may help answer some of your questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>My baby really doesn't need other food or liquid for the first 6 months?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Right. Your breast milk is made just for your baby&nbsp;– it has exactly the right amount of calories.&nbsp;Giving your baby formula or other food or liquid can cause him to gain weight too fast, which can lead to health problems later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, when your baby eats cereal or formula instead of breast milk, your body gets a signal that your milk isn’t needed and starts to make less milk. The more your baby nurses, the more milk your body makes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Will my baby be able to sleep through the night without other foods?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Many moms worry that their babies won't be full enough to sleep through the night with only breast milk. Actually, in the first couple of months, babies need to nurse every few hours, even at night – they aren't supposed to sleep through the night.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>If I breastfeed, will I be the only one who can feed my baby?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Many moms think they won't get a break if they can't have someone else feed the baby. But you can learn how to pump and store breast milk so your baby can eat when you aren't there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also get a baby sling or carrier to make going out with your baby easier. With practice, you may be able to breastfeed in the carrier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's also important to know that babies who&nbsp;breastfeed don't get sick as much as other babies.

High blood pressure can raise your risk of having a heart attack or stroke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The good news is that cutting down on sodium can help lower your blood pressure or keep it at a healthy level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To eat less sodium, you don’t have to make lots of changes at once. Use these tips to help lower the amount of sodium in your diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Know your sodium limit.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Ask your doctor how much sodium is okay for you. The general guidance is:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Healthy adults and teens age 14 and older need to limit their sodium intake to no more than 2,300 mg a day.</li>\r\n\t<li>For people with high blood pressure – and people with blood pressure that’s between normal and high – limiting sodium to 1,500 mg a day may be helpful.</li>\r\n\t<li>Children under age 14 need no more than 1,500 to 2,200 mg a day of sodium, depending on how old they are.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Shop for low-sodium foods.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the sodium we eat doesn’t come from our salt shakers. Sodium is in almost all the processed and prepared foods we buy – even foods that don’t taste salty, like bread or tortillas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you are shopping, limit these items that are high in sodium:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Processed meats, poultry, and seafood – like deli meats, sausages, and sardines</li>\r\n\t<li>Sauces, dressings, and condiments</li>\r\n\t<li>Instant foods,&nbsp;like flavored rice or noodles.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/myhealthfinder/topics/health-conditions/heart-health/lower-sodium-foods-shopping-list\" id=\"anch_31\">Use this shopping list to find lower-sodium foods when you are at the grocery store</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Check the label.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Use the Nutrition Facts label to check the amount of sodium in foods and compare different options.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Try to choose products with 5% Daily Value (DV) or less. A sodium content of 20% DV or more is high.</li>\r\n\t<li>Look for foods labeled “low sodium,” “reduced sodium,” or “no salt added.” But keep in mind that some low-sodium foods don’t have those labels. Check the Nutrition Facts label to be sure!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Make healthy shifts.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Swap out foods that are higher in sodium for healthier options. You can:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Snack on unsalted nuts instead of salted pretzels or chips.</li>\r\n\t<li>Choose skinless chicken and turkey, lean meats, or seafood instead of deli meats or sausages.</li>\r\n\t<li>Go for vegetables that are fresh, frozen, or canned. Pick frozen vegetables without sauce&nbsp;and canned vegetables with the least amount of sodium.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Cook more at home.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Making your own meals is a great way to eat less sodium, because you are in control of what goes into your food.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>If you use canned foods, rinse them before eating or cooking with them. This will wash away some of the salt.</li>\r\n\t<li>Use condiments and spreads that are unsalted or lower in sodium. If you use regular spreads, use less.</li>\r\n\t<li>Don’t add salt to the water when you cook pasta or rice.</li>\r\n\t<li>Try different herbs and spices to flavor your food, like ginger or garlic, instead of salt.</li>\r\n\t<li>Take the salt shaker off your table.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Get less salt when you eat out.</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Ask if there are any lower-sodium dishes on the menu.</li>\r\n\t<li>When you order, ask that salt not be added to your food.</li>\r\n\t<li>Get dressings and sauces on the side so you can add only as much as you need.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Add more potassium to your diet.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Replace high-sodium foods with high-potassium foods. Eating foods with potassium can help lower your blood pressure. Good sources of potassium include potatoes, cantaloupe, bananas, beans, milk, and yogurt.</p>\r\n"

A mini-stroke is also called a TIA, which stands for transient ischemic attack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A TIA happens when blood flow to the brain is blocked for a short period of time — usually a couple of minutes. If you’ve had a TIA, you are at higher risk for having a larger stroke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Never ignore signs of a TIA. Call 911 right away if you or someone else shows signs of a mini-stroke.</p>\r\n"

When you have diabetes, there's too much sugar (glucose) in your blood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you develop gestational diabetes, it can lead to health problems for you and your baby during and after pregnancy. For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>During your pregnancy, your baby is likely to grow bigger than normal. This could make giving birth more difficult – and make it more likely that you'll have a caesarian delivery (C-section).</li>\r\n\t<li>Your baby may be at risk for childhood&nbsp;obesity.</li>\r\n\t<li>You'll be at risk for developing type 2 diabetes after pregnancy. After your baby is born, you'll need to get tested regularly for type 2 diabetes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have gestational diabetes, you and your doctor or midwife can work together to protect you and your baby. You can lower&nbsp;your risk for gestational diabetes by eating healthy and staying active before and during your pregnancy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting tested for gestational diabetes is part of regular prenatal care (health care during pregnancy). Usually, you'll get the test between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>What about cost?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the Affordable Care Act, most health insurance plans must cover testing for gestational diabetes.

Some insurance plans may let you choose a doctor outside your network if you pay more of the cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To find a doctor who takes your insurance:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Call your insurance company and ask for a list of doctors near you who take your insurance plan — or use the insurance company’s website to search for a doctor</li>\r\n\t<li>Then call the doctor’s office and ask them to confirm that they take your plan — have your insurance card handy in case they need to know your plan details</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If you don’t have health insurance, you’ll have to pay for health care out of pocket (on your own).

Be sure to think about how easy or difficult it will be to travel to an appointment. Then call their offices to learn more about them. The answers to the following questions may help you make the best decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Questions about the doctor:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Is the doctor taking new patients?</li>\r\n\t<li>Is the doctor part of a group practice? If so, who are the other doctors that might help care for me?</li>\r\n\t<li>Who will see me if my doctor isn’t available?</li>\r\n\t<li>Which hospital does the doctor use?</li>\r\n\t<li>Does the doctor have experience treating my medical conditions?</li>\r\n\t<li>Does the doctor have special training or certifications?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Questions about the office:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Are evening or weekend appointments available? What about virtual appointments over the phone or on a computer (telemedicine)?</li>\r\n\t<li>What is the cancellation policy?</li>\r\n\t<li>How long will it take to get an appointment?</li>\r\n\t<li>How long do appointments usually last?</li>\r\n\t<li>Can I get lab work and x-rays done in the office?</li>\r\n\t<li>Is there a doctor or nurse who speaks my preferred language?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Think about your experience after the first visit.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Did the doctor and office staff:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Make me feel comfortable during my appointment?</li>\r\n\t<li>Explain things in a way that was easy to understand?</li>\r\n\t<li>Listen carefully to me?</li>\r\n\t<li>Show respect for what I had to say?</li>\r\n\t<li>Know important information about my medical history?</li>\r\n\t<li>Spend enough time with me?</li>\r\n\t<li>Give me a chance to ask questions?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If you answer “no” to any of these questions, you may&nbsp;want to keep looking.</p>\r\n"

It’s more common in older men than younger men.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on your age and other factors, your doctor may recommend getting screened (tested) for prostate cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>If you’re age 55 to 69:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The decision to get screened is a personal choice that you can make after talking with your doctor</li>\r\n\t<li>You might decide that you’re okay with the risks of getting screened, or you might decide the risks aren't worth it</li>\r\n\t<li>Together, you and your doctor can decide what's right for you</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>If you’re age 70 or older:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Prostate screening isn't recommended because the risks outweigh the benefits for most men</li>\r\n\t<li>This is true even if you’re at a higher risk for prostate cancer</li>\r\n\t<li>If you have questions about prostate cancer, talk to your doctor</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Many men have questions about prostate cancer screening. The information below can help you start a conversation with your doctor or nurse about the risks and benefits of screening.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What is the prostate?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The prostate is a gland that helps make semen (the fluid that carries sperm). It’s located below the bladder and in front of the rectum.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Who is at risk for prostate cancer?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Any man can get prostate cancer. But the risk is higher for men who:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Are age 50 or older</li>\r\n\t<li>Are African American</li>\r\n\t<li>Have a father, brother, or son who had prostate cancer</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why isn’t prostate screening recommended for all men?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>All screening tests have both risks and benefits. Here are some things to consider when deciding whether to get screened:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Many prostate cancers grow so slowly that men won't have symptoms or die from the cancer</li>\r\n\t<li>Treatment for prostate cancer can cause problems like erectile dysfunction (impotence) or loss of bladder control</li>\r\n\t<li>Prostate screening sometimes says you have cancer when you really don’t, and follow-up tests can cause problems like infections</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>What do I ask the doctor?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When you visit the doctor, it helps to have questions written down ahead of time. You can also ask a family member or friend to go with you and take notes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Print this list of questions and take it to your next appointment.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Am I at high risk for prostate cancer?</li>\r\n\t<li>Are there things I can do to lower my risk for prostate cancer?</li>\r\n\t<li>What are the risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening and treatment for me?</li>\r\n\t<li>Are there any warning signs or symptoms of prostate cancer to look out for?</li>\r\n\t<li>If the results of the screening test show that I might have prostate cancer, what are my options for diagnosis and treatment?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

                    "Content": "<p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer in the United States. Most people who develop lung cancer (more than 8 in 10) get it from smoking. If you currently smoke, the best way to lower your risk of developing lung cancer is to quit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ask your doctor about getting screened (tested) for lung cancer if&nbsp;<strong>all</strong>&nbsp;of these apply to you:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>You're age 50 to 80</li>\r\n\t<li>You have a history of heavy smoking — specifically,&nbsp;you smoked an average of 1 pack of cigarettes a day for 20 years — <strong>or&nbsp;</strong>2 packs a day for 10 years</li>\r\n\t<li>You smoke now,&nbsp;<strong>or</strong> you quit within the last 15 years</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor may suggest that you get screened once a year with LDCT (low-dose helical computed tomography). LDCT takes detailed pictures of your lungs, which can help find lung cancer early – when it may be easier to treat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/health-care-law-protections/\" id=\"anch_31\">Affordable Care Act</a>, the health care reform law passed in 2010, insurance plans must cover lung cancer screening for adults ages 50 to 80 who are at high risk for lung cancer. This means you may be able to get screened at no cost to you. Talk to your insurance company to find out more.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What do I ask the doctor?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Visiting the doctor can be stressful. It helps to have questions written down ahead of time.

Diabetes is a chronic (long-term) condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many things can put you at risk for type 2 diabetes. For example, you're more likely to get type 2 diabetes if you're over age 45, you're overweight, or you have prediabetes. People with prediabetes have blood glucose levels higher than normal, but not high enough to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Having prediabetes increases your risk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diabetes is a leading cause of disability and death in the United States. The good news is that you can do a lot to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Watching your weight</li>\r\n\t<li>Eating healthy</li>\r\n\t<li>Staying active</li>\r\n\t<li>Quitting smoking</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Talk with your doctor or nurse about steps you can take to prevent type 2 diabetes. Your doctor may also refer you to a registered dietician. A registered dietician is a health professional who helps people with healthy eating.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What do I ask the doctor?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When you visit the doctor, it helps to have questions written down ahead of time. You can also ask a family member or friend to go with you to take notes.&nbsp;Print this list of questions and take it&nbsp;with you to your next appointment.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Am I at risk for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes?&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Do you recommend that I get tested for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes?</li>\r\n\t<li>What are the warning signs and symptoms of type 2 diabetes?</li>\r\n\t<li>If I'm overweight, how much weight do I need to lose to lower my risk?</li>\r\n\t<li>What are some healthy ways to lose weight and keep it off?</li>\r\n\t<li>How much physical activity do I need to help prevent or delay type 2 diabetes?</li>\r\n\t<li>What changes can I make to my diet to help prevent or delay type 2 diabetes?</li>\r\n\t<li>Do my blood pressure numbers and cholesterol levels increase my risk for type 2 diabetes?</li>\r\n\t<li>Can you give me some information about preventing type 2 diabetes to take home with me?</li>\r\n\t<li>Can you refer me to a diabetes prevention program nearby?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

Your body needs calcium to build strong bones and help prevent osteoporosis (bone loss).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best way to get enough calcium is to eat more dairy products. Foods with added calcium and vitamin D can also help — and so can certain vegetables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take the list below with you the next time you go food shopping.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Dairy Products</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Look for fat-free or low-fat dairy products.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Fat-free or low-fat (1%) milk</li>\r\n\t<li>Fat-free or low-fat yogurt (choose options with no added sugars)</li>\r\n\t<li>Low-fat cheese (3 grams of fat or less per serving)</li>\r\n\t<li>Soymilk with added calcium, vitamin A, and vitamin D</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Vegetables</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also get calcium from vegetables like:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Soybeans (edamame)</li>\r\n\t<li>Kale</li>\r\n\t<li>Turnip greens</li>\r\n\t<li>Chinese cabbage (bok choy)</li>\r\n\t<li>Collard greens</li>\r\n\t<li>Broccoli</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If you buy canned vegetables, watch out for sodium. Read the Nutrition Facts label and choose the option with the least sodium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you buy frozen vegetables, check the Nutrition Facts label and choose ones without butter or cream sauces.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Foods with Added Calcium</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Check the Nutrition Facts label to look for foods that have 10% or more DV of calcium added, like:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Breakfast cereal</li>\r\n\t<li>Tofu</li>\r\n\t<li>100% orange juice</li>\r\n\t<li>Soymilk, almond milk, or rice milk</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Foods with Vitamin D</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Also be sure to look for foods with Vitamin D. Vitamin D helps your body absorb (take in) calcium.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Vitamin D is added to some foods, like milk, breakfast cereals, and juice. Check the Nutrition Facts label.</li>\r\n\t<li>You can also get some vitamin D from many types of fish like salmon, tuna, and trout.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

Active TB can spread from person to person through the air, like when someone with active TB sneezes or coughs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes, people have TB but it doesn’t make them feel sick. This is called latent tuberculosis infection&nbsp;(LTBI). People with LTBI may not know they have TB – so they need to get tested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Talk to your doctor about getting tested for LTBI if you:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Were born in or have lived in a country where TB is common – for example, Mexico, the Philippines, Vietnam, India, or China</li>\r\n\t<li>Live or have lived in a large group setting – for example, a homeless shelter or a prison</li>\r\n\t<li>Have HIV or another condition that weakens your immune system (the system in the body that fights infection)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have LTBI, you can’t pass it on to others by sneezing or coughing. But if LTBI isn’t treated, it can turn into active TB. This could make you very sick, and you could then pass TB on to others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember, LTBI doesn’t cause any signs or symptoms – so the only way to know if you have it is to get tested.

If you have HIV (also called being HIV-positive), early treatment can help you live a longer, healthier life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only way to know if you have HIV is to get tested. Everyone ages 15 to 65 needs to get tested for HIV at least once. All pregnant women also need to get tested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you get tested at a doctor’s office or clinic, you can ask for a&nbsp;<strong>confidential</strong>&nbsp;test. The test results will be shared only with people you allow&nbsp;to see your medical records. Some clinics offer&nbsp;<strong>anonymous</strong>&nbsp;HIV testing. This means that you don’t have to give your name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the health care reform law, insurance plans must cover HIV testing. Depending on your insurance plan, you may be able to get HIV counseling at no cost to you.
